            Workshops in Azerbaijan offer a unique opportunity to dive deep into the countryâ€™s 
            rich cultural heritage and artistic traditions. These hands-on experiences allow participants 
            to engage directly with local artisans and experts, learning skills such as traditional carpet
            weaving, pottery making, and Azerbaijani cooking. Workshops cater to all ages and skill levels, 
            promoting creativity and cultural exchange while fostering a sense of community. Participants 
            can discover the intricate techniques behind local crafts and immerse themselves in the storytelling 
            that accompanies each art form. Whether you're crafting a beautiful piece of art or preparing a 
            delicious dish, these workshops provide not just skills but also meaningful 
            connections to Azerbaijani culture, making them a memorable part of any visit.
